    ================================================================
    Testing Plan: 

    As the majority of our game is tested visually, our testing was primarily 
    done by play testing. 
    We have shortcuts to each GUI for catching, battling, safari zone 
    exploration and intro dialouge. These test the gui functions and displays 
    in [battle_encounter.mli], [battle.mli], [safari_zone.mli], and 
    [main_menu.mli] respectfully. We use a combination of black-box and
    glass-box testing to verify our code. We also use unit tests to test our 
    game engine. 

    Our testing demonstrates the correctness of the system because it has a 
    quantitative measurement for the code tested with unit cases, and the 
    visual GUI aspects are clearly correctly rendered or incorrectly rendered 
    when we launch the game and run sequences of inputs.
    
    ================================================================*)

(********************************************************************
   Here are some helper functions for your testing of set-like lists.
 ********************************************************************)

(** [cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2] compares two lists to see whether
    they are equivalent set-like lists. That means checking two things.
    First, they must both be {i set-like}, meaning that they do not
    contain any duplicates. Second, they must contain the same elements,
    though not necessarily in the same order. *)
let cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2 =
  let uniq1 = List.sort_uniq compare lst1 in
  let uniq2 = List.sort_uniq compare lst2 in
  List.length lst1 = List.length uniq1
  && List.length lst2 = List.length uniq2
  && uniq1 = uniq2

(** [pp_string s] pretty-prints string [s]. *)
let pp_string s = "\"" ^ s ^ "\""

let pp_bool bool = if bool = true then "true" else "false"

(** [pp_list pp_elt lst] pretty-prints list [lst], using [pp_elt] to
    pretty-print each element of [lst]. *)
(* let pp_list pp_elt lst = let pp_elts lst = let rec loop n acc =
   function | [] -> acc | [ h ] -> acc ^ pp_elt h | h1 :: (h2 :: t as
   t') -> if n = 100 then acc ^ "..." (* stop printing long list *) else
   loop (n + 1) (acc ^ pp_elt h1 ^ "; ") t' in loop 0 "" lst in "[" ^
   pp_elts lst ^ "]" *)

(* These tests demonstrate how to use [cmp_set_like_lists] and [pp_list]
   to get helpful output from OUnit. *)
